# Security & Privacy Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the GATE CSE Platform and provides guidelines for maintaining user privacy and data security.

## Data Protection

### User Information Security
- **Phone Number Encoding**: User phone numbers are encoded using Base64 before local storage
- **No Plaintext Storage**: Sensitive data is never stored in plaintext in localStorage
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive configurations use environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys, URLs, or sensitive data in source code

### Google Forms Integration Security
```javascript
// ✅ SECURE - Using environment variables
const formUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_FORM_URL;

// ❌ INSECURE - Hardcoded URL (avoided)
const formUrl = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/actual-form-id/formResponse";
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Encoding
```javascript
// Encoding before storage
const hashedUser = {
  ...user,
  phone: btoa(user.phone) // Base64 encoding
};

// Decoding after retrieval
const user = {
  ...hashedUser,
  phone: atob(hashedUser.phone) // Base64 decoding
};
```

### Environment Variables Configuration
Required environment variables for production:
- `VITE_GOOGLE_FORM_URL`: Google Form response endpoint
- `VITE_GOOGLE_FORM_NAME_FIELD`: Form field ID for name
- `VITE_GOOGLE_FORM_PHONE_FIELD`: Form field ID for phone

### Graceful Degradation
- App works even if Google Form is not configured
- Error handling prevents data loss
- User registration succeeds locally regardless of form submission status

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Always use `.env.example` for documentation
2. **Validate all inputs** - Client-side and server-side validation
3. **Use HTTPS** - Ensure all production deployments use HTTPS
4. **Regular Updates** - Keep dependencies updated for security patches
5. **Error Handling** - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

### For Deployment
1. **Environment Variables**: Set all required environment variables in hosting platform
2. **CORS Configuration**: Properly configure CORS for API endpoints
3. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers if needed
4. **Access Controls**: Limit access to admin features and sensitive data

## Data Retention Policy

### Local Storage
- User preferences and progress stored locally
- No sensitive authentication tokens stored
- Data can be cleared by user at any time

### Google Forms
- Submitted data follows Google's privacy policy
- Data used only for progress tracking
- No data shared with third parties

## Privacy Compliance

### User Rights
- Users can clear their local data anytime
- No tracking cookies or persistent identifiers
- Minimal data collection (only name and phone)
- Transparent data usage

### GDPR Considerations
- Right to erasure: Users can clear local storage
- Data minimization: Only essential data collected
- Purpose limitation: Data used only for stated purposes
- Transparency: Clear privacy notices provided

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Issues
1. **Immediate Response**: Remove compromised configurations
2. **User Notification**: Inform users if their data may be affected
3. **Investigation**: Analyze the scope and impact
4. **Remediation**: Implement fixes and security improvements
5. **Documentation**: Update security procedures

### Reporting Security Issues
- Create GitHub issue with "security" label
- Provide detailed description of the vulnerability
- Include steps to reproduce if applicable
- Suggest potential fixes or mitigations

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] No hardcoded sensitive data in source code
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for production
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive info
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Local storage data is encoded
- [ ] Google Form permissions properly set
- [ ] README includes security setup instructions

## Monitoring and Alerts

### What to Monitor
- Failed login attempts (unusual patterns)
- Unexpected API calls
- Environment variable misconfigurations
- Client-side JavaScript errors related to security

### Alerting
- Set up monitoring for production errors
- Configure alerts for security-related events
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Monitor Google Form submission rates

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Enhanced Encryption**: Implement proper encryption for local data
2. **Session Management**: Add secure session handling
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit trails
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Consider 2FA for sensitive operations

### Security Tools Integration
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Regular penetration testing

**Note**: Security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update these guidelines as the platform evolves and new security threats emerge.
